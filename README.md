# Diabetes Prediction Application

Predict the likelihood of diabetes using machine learning techniques with our Diabetes Prediction Application. Utilizing a dataset consisting of various health metrics, the application employs algorithms to provide accurate predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset includes the following features:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Insulin level
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age

The target variable is 'Outcome', indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of diabetes.

## Usage

1. **Data Import**: Load the dataset into the application.
2. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models using the provided dataset.
3. **Prediction**: Input new data to predict the likelihood of diabetes.
4. **Result Analysis**: Analyze prediction results and assess model performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started
